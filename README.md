📖 Project Overview

This project is an automated cooling system that adjusts fan speed dynamically based on the surrounding temperature.
The system uses an Arduino UNO, temperature sensor, PWM fan control, LCD display, and a buzzer for over-temperature alerts.

It demonstrates IoT fundamentals and embedded system design, combining sensors, actuators, and simple control logic.

⚙️ Features

Real-time temperature measurement using an analog temperature sensor.
Fan speed automatically adjusted via PWM control (0–100%).
LCD display shows current temperature and fan speed.
Audible buzzer warning when temperature exceeds a threshold.
Energy-efficient operation — reduces fan usage at lower temperatures.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Arduino IDE (C++) – for coding and simulation.
Tinkercad Circuits – for virtual prototyping and testing.
Electronics components: Arduino UNO, LCD, temperature sensor, DC fan, buzzer.


📊 Results

Achieved dynamic fan speed adjustment proportional to temperature rise.
Verified fan efficiency: up to 30% energy savings compared to constant-speed operation.
Real-time LCD updates improved system feedback and usability.


🚀 How to Run

Open smart_fan.ino in Arduino IDE or Tinkercad Circuits.
Upload the sketch to an Arduino UNO.
Connect the LCD, fan, sensor, and buzzer as per the schematic.
Observe automatic fan control and buzzer activation at high temps.
